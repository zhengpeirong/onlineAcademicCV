Research Experience
===================

* 2022 Spring: Undergraduate Student Researcher
* [Supervisorï¼šDakun Lai(Professor), UESTC-BMI-EP](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/dklai/zh_CN/index.htm)
  * Established a comprehensive database by integrating data from three public databases and conducted meticulous preprocessing. The database comprised a total of 855,882 heartbeat activities, including 30 segments of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) and 30 segments of normal heart rate.
  * Designed a robust semi-supervised learning model utilizing a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) architecture. Implemented on TensorFlow, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 90.16% using only 10% of the available training data for binary classification of ECG signals.
  * Successfully published the research outcomes in the prestigious conference EMBC'23, and I am going to give an oral presentation to highlight the significance of the findings.
